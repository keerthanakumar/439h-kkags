1. The processor starts executing 32-bit code after the ljmp instruction at 0x7c2d. This ljmp instruction jumps to a 32-bit code segment. The lgdt instruction previous to the ljmp instruction prepared the global descriptor table (gdt) that enables 32-bit mode. The sequence of movl, orl, and movl directly before the ljmp set the protected mode bit of control register 0 (cr0) so that the hardware knows to run in protected mode.
